# WIP, what is this?

Hello, this is my first attempt at a game. The ultimate goal is to just have 3D shapes throughout the sky, and allow the player to jump from shape to shape until they get to a certain level.

# How does it work?

W,A,S,D controls, along with the ability to Jump. You spawn in, and can jump and walk around.


# Coming soon

As of this README (6|10|2024), the only things implemented are the Jumping feature, some structures, and I have just started to create a player, which the camera will be tied too, and used for collisions.

Far in the future once the core gameplay is built, checkpoints, punishments, and level selectors will all most likely be added.


# Demo as of 6|10|2024
