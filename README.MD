# WIP, what is this?

Hello, this is my first attempt at a game. The ultimate goal is to just have 3D shapes throughout the sky, and allow the player to jump from shape to shape until they get to a certain level.

# How does it work?

W,A,S,D controls, along with the ability to Jump. You spawn in, and can jump and walk around.
Read Commented code for detailed technical explanation


# Coming soon

As of this README (6|20|2024), I have added some buggy collisions, and I cant remember if I already added sprints or not, but you can now see sprinting in the demo gif

Far in the future once the core gameplay is built, checkpoints, punishments, and level selectors will all most likely be added.


# Demo as of 6|10|2024
